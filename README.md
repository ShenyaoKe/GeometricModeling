# GeometricModeling
CSCE 645/VIZA 675: Geometric Modeling

# Includes:
1. Curve Editor
 * Arbitrary curve degree supported;
 * Implemented with OpenGL4 tessellation shaders, and Qt5;
 * Import and export curve data function supported;
 * An additional project called Centripetal Catmull-Rom Curve Editor in this project.
2. Diffusion Curve
 * Draw curve and set side colors supported;
 * Read and saving data supported.
3. Catmul-Clark Subdvision Surface
 * Classical Catmull-Clark subdivision algorithm implemented.
4. Mesh Simplification
 * Half-edge data structure implemented.
5. Barber - Hair Modeling Tool
 *  Selection and curve display functions were implemented with OpenGL4 shaders;
 *  Implemented camera space object transformation operation;
 *  Massive spring system were implemented to simulation hair motion.

# More projects will be added soon.
